# Intuitionistic Logic in Lean4

In this project, I aim to formalize Propositional Intuitionistic Logic and to prove essential results for it, culminating with two proofs of the Completeness theorem, corresponding to the two semantics presented: Kripke and algebraic. Furthermore, I provide a connection between the two semantics, proving the equivalence between the notions of validity generated by them.
