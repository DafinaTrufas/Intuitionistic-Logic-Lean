This repository contains a formalization of Intuitionistic Propositional Logic in the Lean proof assistant. The language we work with has falsity, conjunction, disjunction and implication as primitive connectives and for syntactical inference we use the Hilbert-style proof system introduced by GÃ¶del. Our approach focuses on verifying two completeness proofs for the studied logical system, as well as exploring the relation between the two analyzed semantical paradigms - Kripke and algebraic. The original contribution of this project consists in formalizing the Heyting algebras semantics, verifying the completeness with respect to it and establishing the equivalence between the notions of validity induced by the two semantics.
