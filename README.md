# Intuitionistic Logic in Lean4

In this project, I aim to formalize propositional and first-order Intuitionistic Logic and to prove essential results, the central goal I want to achieve being the completeness theorem.
For the moment, the formalization includes the definition of the syntax and semantics for the Propositional Inutitionistic Calculus, along with proofs of the soundness theorem, and the most auxiliary results needed for
proving the completeness theorem.
The file `Syntax.lean` contains, in addition to the definitions and proofs needed for completeness (such as disjunctive theories, consistent and complete pairs), a set of theorems and deduction-rules.
